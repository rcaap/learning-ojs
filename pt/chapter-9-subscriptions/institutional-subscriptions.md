Institutional subscriptions are managed similarly to individual subscriptions, but are used for libraries, research institutes, and other organizes that subscribe to your journal.

You can create a new individual subscription by using the Create New Subscription link. First, however, you will need to create a new account for the institution's contact person under Users & Roles \(see Chapter 7\). Once that is done, you can search for the account here, and apply the different configurations.

**Subscription Type**: Select the appropriate type for this new subscriber \(e.g., Library\) and its status \(e.g., Active\).

> Subscription Types were configured earlier in this chapter.

**Date**: Set the start and end dates for this subscription.

**Institution**: Add the name of the institution for this subscription \(e.g., Simon Fraser University Library\).

**Mailing Address**: Add the address of the institution.

**Domain**: Readers coming from a computer with this domain will automatically receive access \(e.g., sfu.ca\). This will apply to on-campus users.

**IP Ranges**: The institution may provide you with IP ranges. Readers coming from a computer from this IP range will automatically receive access.

**Notes**: If you have any relevant notes to add, record that information here \(optional\).
